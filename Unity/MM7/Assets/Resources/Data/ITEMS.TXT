Ever true to their nature, Regna's smiths fashioned a weapon that would aid their imperial ""tax collection"" efforts on the high seas and coastal towns.  To this date, Regna has not forged a weapon that didn't advance their selfish goals at the expense of others."		
504	item235	Golden Chain	20000	armor	Chain	16	56	Artifact	20	Artifact	21	0	0	0	0							(Half damage from missile attacks, +10 to all statistics) Owned by Colonial Governor Padish at the Time of the Silence, this fantastic armor has resurfaced in many of the great treasure hoardes throughout history.  Like most creations turned out by the Heavenly Forge, it is nearly indestructible, and its like can no longer be made by any forge in the land.

506	item223	Splitter	20000	Missile	Axe	4d12	22	Artifact	20	Artifact	7	0	0	16	80							(Explosive impact, Fire Resistance +50) Though powerful, Splitter is never wielded by a single owner for long.  The blade gives off great blasts of fire when struck, and the magical protection against fire the weapon offers isn't enough to completely shield a user from the blast.		
507	item226	Ghoulsbane	20000	Weapon2	Axe	4d10	30	Artifact	20	Artifact	8	0	0	37	142							(Undead slaying, Immunity to paralysis, 3-18 fire damage) Ghoulsbane was commissioned by the Church of the Sun more than 150 years ago as part of their effort to destroy the ever growing population of undead created by the Church of the Moon.  Though powerful, it is only one weapon, and the undead are legion.  The Church of the Sun fell in 1083 A.S.		
508	item225	The Slayer	20000	Missile	Spear	7d9	35	Artifact	20	Artifact	9	0	0	5	120							(Undead slaying, Dragon slaying, Demon slaying) A humorless weapon, to say the least, The Slayer was forged by Judicia the Virile to help end the Age of Monsters, and promote the Age of Man.  A noble idea, but one that hasn't worked out very well.  The Slayer often goes missing for years, only to be rediscovered in some dragon's hoard by ambitious adventurers.  The power of the weapon often inspires such adventurers to move the weapon to another dragon hoard, where it once again goes missing for years.		
509	item227	Charele	20000	Weapon1or2	Spear	6d10	38	Artifact	20	Artifact	11	0	0	13	120							"Built at the behest of Hareck I during the formation of the Regnan ""Empire"", Charele was named after his wife, Queen Charele.

Heartbreaker requires no arrows, firing bolts of ice formed when the string is drawn back.  Its origins are unknown, but the style suggests Elvish make.		
511	item244	Hands of the Master	20000	Gauntlets	Misc	6	18	Artifact	20	Artifact	30	0	0	0	0							(Unarmed skill +10, Dodging skill +10) The Hands of the Master are meant for Monks, but a few Thieves have put them to use with excellent results.  Most of the owners have gone on to fame and fortune, but the last one obviously didn't do so well.		
512	item312	Seven League Boots	20000	Boots	Misc	4	26	Artifact	20	Artifact	31	0	0	0	0							(Speed +40, of Water Magic) So named for their boost to their wearer's reflexes and pace, the Boots true function is to ease the use of Water Magic in order to speed travel.  Anyone using the boots is destined for greatness, but not necessarily honor.  Much mischief can be attributed to previous owners of these boots.

Annoyed, the Gods cursed the First Ogre with Mash, and all Ogres have since borne the mark of that act--strong, but slow, dull, and stupid.  In any event, Mash is yours now.

It was especially tuned to promote Spirit magic, but that same attunement leaves the wielder somewhat open to Mind and Body based attacks.

The hammer's connection to the elements leaves the wielder vulnerable to elemental magic, but it is a small price to pay for the enhanced Self ability and Might the hammer provides.		
529	item281	Hermes' Sandals	30000	Boots	Misc	4	36	Artifact	0	Sandals	114	0	0	0	0							(+100 Speed, +50 Accuracy, +50 Air Resistance, Regenerate HP, Regenerate SP, Feather Falling) Rumored to be the footwear of a god, the winged sandals confer enormous power on the wearer.

531	item008	Elfbane	15000	Weapon	Sword	9d8	24	Artifact	0	Two-Handed Sword	2	0	0	22	139							(Of Shielding, Elf Slayer, Orc) This sword was created by the goblins for their Chief at the time, Grogar.  Unfortunately, the goblins lost the war and Elfbane was lost for quite some time.  Enchanted to both slay elves, and protect its wielder from arrows, Elfbane truly lives up to its name.  A curious side effect of the enchantment renders the weapon unusable by all but a goblin.

The string is too hard to pull back, it doesn't remain steady enough while aiming, and it seems a little off-balance.		
543	item045	The Perfect Bow	4000	Missile	Bow	7d9	36	Special	0	Bow	12	0	0	12	40							This bow seems to know its wielder's strength and adjusts itself accordingly.  You never have to struggle to pull the string back, and it's always easy to hold your shot until you're ready to fire.  Dozens of small advantages like this in the design of the bow make for the finest weapon of its type you have ever seen.
